🚀 Automating UI Testing with Playwright + TypeScript + Allure Reporting 📊

As part of my ongoing work with Playwright, I’ve put together a Proof of Concept (POC) to automate end-to-end testing and test reporting with a seamless integration of Allure.

🧑‍💻 The Challenge:
Efficiently running Playwright UI tests while generating clear, interactive reports automatically after every test run — without needing to manually trigger or clean up reports.

🔧 The Solution:
I built a fully automated test suite using Playwright + TypeScript and integrated Allure reporting. Here's how it works:

Test Automation:

I wrote a set of tests using Playwright to simulate real-user interactions like login validation (both positive and negative scenarios).

The Playwright test suite is easy to extend with more test cases.

Automatic Report Generation:

Once the tests run, the old Allure results and report folders are automatically deleted to ensure a fresh start.

After tests are completed, Allure generates a rich, interactive test report and opens it in the browser — all automatically!

No Manual Cleanup or Commands:

No need to manually run commands for Allure or clean up old reports.

Everything from cleaning old results, running tests, generating the report, to opening it is handled automatically after each test run.

📊 Key Features:
Playwright automates end-to-end testing of web applications.

Allure provides beautiful and interactive test reports.

Automatic Cleanup of old test results before each run.

Automatic Report Opening after test execution.

🎯 Why It Matters:
Automating test execution and reporting in this way increases efficiency and scalability, and ensures a clean testing environment every time. It saves time, reduces human error, and provides real-time feedback with a professional-quality report after every test run.

📈 Results: Real-time insights from the generated Allure report help identify flaky tests and failed scenarios, improving overall test coverage and product quality.
